Here is an overview of some of the world’s most financially powerful terrorist organizations, based on recent and authoritative sources:

**1. Hezbollah**
- Estimated annual revenue: Up to $1.1 billion (as of 2017, still considered one of the wealthiest in 2025)
- Main funding sources: State sponsorship (especially from Iran), international criminal activities, and legitimate businesses.[^6]

**2. ISIS (Islamic State of Iraq and Syria)**
- Estimated annual revenue: At its peak, ISIS controlled oil fields, taxation, and extortion, generating hundreds of millions to over $1 billion annually. While its financial power has declined since its territorial defeat, it remains one of the richest terrorist groups due to residual funds and ongoing criminal activities.[^8][^5]

**9. Houthis (Ansar Allah)**

**10. Al-Nusrah Front (Hay’at Tahrir al-Sham)**
