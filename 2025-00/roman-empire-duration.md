### AI

The Roman Empire lasted for **about 1,500 years**, depending on how you define its start and end:

- **Imperial Rome (Principate & Dominate):**
    - Traditionally, the Roman Empire began in **27 BCE** when **Octavian (Augustus)** became the first emperor.
    - The **Western Roman Empire** fell in **476 CE** when the last emperor, **Romulus Augustulus**, was deposed by the Germanic chieftain Odoacer.
    - This means the Western Roman Empire lasted **503 years** (27 BCE -- 476 CE).
    
- **Eastern Roman Empire (Byzantine Empire):**
    - The Eastern part of the empire, known as the **Byzantine Empire**, continued after the fall of the West.
    - It lasted until the **fall of Constantinople in 1453 CE** to the Ottoman Turks.
    - This means the Byzantine Empire lasted **nearly 1,000 years** after the fall of the West.

So, if we count both, the Roman Empire as a whole lasted from **27 BCE
to 1453 CE**, about **1,480 years**!
